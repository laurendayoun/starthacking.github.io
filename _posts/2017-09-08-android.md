Before you get started, you should make sure that you have JDK 6 or higher. You
can check this by opening up a terminal and running `javac -version`. If
successful, the output should look something like `javac 1.7.0_45`. Anything
greater than `1.6` is fine. Otherewise, you can get JDK [here][jdk-download].

You can install Android Studio on your Mac by following these steps:

1. Start by downloading Android Studio from the [official site][download].
2. Open the `.dmg` disk image.
3. Drag and drop the "Android Studio" icon onto the Applications folder.
4. Go to the Applications folder and open Android Studio.
5. Follow the setup wizard to configure Android Studio.
    1. Choose "Custom" when choosing the type of setup.
    2. Select everything when selecting what components to install.
    3. Use the recommended amount of RAM for HAXM (if applicable).
    4. Individually accept each license and click "Finish" to complete configuration.
    5. Wait until all components are downloaded and installed. You may need
       your administrator password to install HAXM.
